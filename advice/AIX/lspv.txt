This is GPFS L2 support for your case, did some investigation that it seems your lspv information was not refreshed,
to force refresh is to just remove file /var/mmfs/gen/nsdpvol and then run mmlspv, it will generate the new nsdpvol
file and then mmlspv will return the new cached data. Then try lspv again.



Tips:

1) mmlspv is to find out which disks have been formatted as GPFS NSDs, it read data from /var/mmfs/gen/nsdpvol,
if the mmlspv script cannot find the file, it will re-scan the local disks and recreate it.
2) If mmlspv shows correctly but still get the wrong answer from lspv, you need to talk with AIX guys.
