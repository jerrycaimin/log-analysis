In /var/log/messages there are fsstruct errors indicating metadata corruption for 61 inodes.
$ fsstructlx.awk  */var/log/messages | grep lookup | cut -f 2 -d '(' | cut -f 1 -d ')' | sort | uniq | wc -l
61    
 
I recommend that you unmount the filesystem on all nodes and run an offline mmfsck.  

# script 
# mmfsck gpfsFS1  -v -n | tee mmfsck_gpfsFS1_n.out
# exit 

Send in the typescript file for us to evaluate.  
You can also mount the filesystem after the mmfsck -n completes in service mode:
mmmount gpfsFS1 -o rs 
and you can run a tsfindinode giving it a file containing the list of bad inodes (see above). 
This will allow you to identify the bad inodes.   
Call the support center and have them pageout the oncall to evaluate the mmfsck output,  then you can run the mmfsck -y.

# script
# mmfsck gpfsFS1 -v -y | tee mmfsck_gpfsFS1_y.out
# exit

Send in the new typescript file for us to evaluate it.

1. Check fs with fsstructlx.awk on /var/log/message if any "errorcode=lookup", by this cmd:
$ fsstructlx.awk  */var/log/messages | grep lookup 

2. If fs corrupt identified, try to unmount all the fs:
# mmumount /gpfsFS1 -a
# mmlsmount all -L

3. run the mmfsck gpfsFS1 -v -n to check the output(not to fix), Policy: 
>>>>>>>>>>>If no inode in reserved problem, can run mmfsck -y, else involve dev to check. 
Analysis gpfsFS1 -v -n report, sample:
#######################
There are total 182 bad entries from the mmfsck -n output, include the duplicated address, bad indirect block and bad directory enties:

You need run the offline fsck -y to fix above problems. 
Some files will be moved into lost+found directory after fsck -y, 
and fsck will punch a hole for the duplicated address, the application will hit input/output errors when access the hole. 
grep these iNum to ./inode.list

Following are the steps of the offline fsck:
1. Mount the file system in read only mode on a node, for example az18u3257
   # mmmount gpfsFS1 -o ro

2. Run tsfindinode to find out the corrupted files
   # tsfindinode -i ./inode.list /gpfsFS1

3. Backup the files found in step 2 to other place, for example, the local fs.

4. unmount the file system
   # mmumount gpfsFS1 -a
   # mmlsmount gpfsFS1 -L

4. Run mmfsck -y to fix the problem
   # mmfsck gpfsFS1 -v -y | tee mmfsck_gpfsFS1_y.out

5. If you have backup, recover the corrupted files from backup

6. Send the mmfsck_gpfsFS1_y.out to us for check
 
Please run above steps in the 'script' command. Thanks.

I think you can mount the file system of all the nodes and start your application. Thanks.





Looks like the log file is corrupt. Like you said, there are not fsstruct errors logged, but that is no guarantee that fs is not corrupt. You will need to run offline fsck to at least repair log files -

mmfsck <fs> -xk

- if ct has time to run full offline fsck, then that is preferable -

mmdsh -N all mmfsadm test fsck usePatchQueue 0
mmfsck <fs> -Vnm -xc -xsc --threads 128 -N <nsd server nodes> --patch-file <patch-file-name>  2>&1 | tee /tmp/fsckn.out
