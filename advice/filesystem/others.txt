Generally speaking, most of these corruptions happen
due to power outages, bad
hardware (bad disks or bad sectors on disks), something wrong within the
storage subsystem etc. so we can't say for sure what exactly caused it
here unfortunately. Once the issue is resolved though, we can perhaps
monitor the system, and as
soon as any FSSTRUCT-related messages are observed in the logs, we can
take a quick trace for a review. I don't think it should happen again
though if everything is working fine.

Important: Set the value of unmountOnDiskFail to meta for FPO deployment or when the file system metadata and data replica are more than one.
