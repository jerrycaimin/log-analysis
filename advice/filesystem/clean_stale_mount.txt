Here are steps to clean stale_mount issue:

1. adjust 3 file systems' mount points, making sure each fs has
dedicated and independent mount point. Cmd is :

mmchfs <fs name> -T <new mount point>                /*unmount fs from
all nodes before issue this cmd*/

2. mount all fs back and verify mmlsmount all -L

3. login cluster mgr node (verify it by mmlsmgr -c) and run:
mmsysmoncontrol restart

This will create a bit load IOs in cluster wide so it is suggested not
to run in peak hours.

4. run mmhealth again and verify status
