Once our CCR configuration can not be decided, almost all GPFS commands will fail with such message. For more details, please search in PSDB.

c80f5m5n04 Mon Aug 31 00:25:06 0]~# mmgetstate -a
get file failed: err 801
gpfsClusterInit: Unexpected error from ccr fget mmsdrfs.  Return code: 149
mmgetstate: Command failed. Examine previous error messages to determine cause.

Solution: TS001658132



Error 809:
- If the CCR state on a majority of quorum+tiebreakerdisk is intact then CCR can start up. Or err 809 will be reported.
(TS001648392)

Error 801:
- If CCR is started up, but if any file in the CCR repo was corrupted on the 2 nodes, CCR is not able to get the file,
then err 801 will be reported. (TS001658132)

err 801 usually means CCR state is inconsistent among a majority of the quorum nodes/tiebreakerDisks.
This can happen when the files under /var/mmfs/ccr was corrupted or out-of-dated.

1) find all paxos files from quorum nodes, just use the latest one, discard all others.

2) copy all files in committed/ from all quorum nodes, into one folder, delete mismatch crc ones. (filename with bad)

3) do "mmccr patchpaxos" to make a new paxos file.

4) copy back those new paxos file and committed/ to all quorum nodes.

5) startup
