mmafmctl to control the fileset of remote fs


>>Q1. We want to know how each way works by the following point of view.
>>a. what happen about the changes that have queued at
>>   stop/suspend/unlink?
Yes, these operations are not documented proper in this version, and
will be documented in next release.
Queue or not queue:
stop: Not queue.
suspend: Queue.
unlink: Not queue.

>>Q2. what happen about the changes that were made on stopped/suspended state?
[stop/restart]: stops the replication, applications can access the
fileset while operations are not queued,
applications can modify the data, when fileset is restarted recovery
will be run to recover the pending operations.
[suspend/resume]: stops the replication , but messages are still queued
at gateway node. Used for temporary stall of replication
[unlink/link]: applications cannot access the fileset
For this problem I suggest you to run stop/restart which can stop the
queue increasement. 



1, AFM State
Please refer to below link to check AFM state, it provides state description and related actions

2, Enable 'auto mount' on remote file system
In AFM solution, we need mount remote file system on source side, it is different to enable auto mount on remote file system than local file system.
For remote file system, we need use 'mmremotefs update Device -A yes' to enable and use 'mmremotefs show Device' to check
For local file system, we need use 'mmchfs Device -A yes' to enable and use 'mmlsfs Device -A' to check
