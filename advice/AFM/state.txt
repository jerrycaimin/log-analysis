mmafmctl to control the fileset of remote fs

Yes, these operations are not documented proper in this version, and
will be documented in next release.
Queue or not queue:
stop: Not queue.
suspend: Queue.
unlink: Not queue.

>>Q2. what happen about the changes that were made on stopped/suspended state?
[stop/restart]: stops the replication, applications can access the
fileset while operations are not queued,
applications can modify the data, when fileset is restarted recovery
will be run to recover the pending operations.
[suspend/resume]: stops the replication , but messages are still queued
at gateway node. Used for temporary stall of replication
[unlink/link]: applications cannot access the fileset
For this problem I suggest you to run stop/restart which can stop the
queue increasement.
