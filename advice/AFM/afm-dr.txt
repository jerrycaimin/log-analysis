Failover process:

1) Failover to secondary: mmafmctl fs1 failoverToSecondary -j scaletest001
2) write data to secondary nsd#4
3) Run failback at primary to get modified data at primary site:
	a) mmafmctl <fs> failbackToPrimary -j <fsetName> --start
	b) mmafmctl <fs> applyUpdates -j <fsetName>
	-- this step needs to be run so that we can get as close to secondary site in terms of data..
	c) When workload at the secondary site is very minimal, stop the applications on the secondary
	-- Run "mmafmctl <fs> applyUpdates -j <fsetName>" -- one last time to get these data after application is stopped
	d) mmafmctl <fs> failbackToPrimary -j <fsetName> --stop
4) mmchfileset fs1 scaletest001 -p afmmode=secondary -p afmPrimaryId=xxxxxxxxx at the secondary site

this is the actual failover/failback mechanism, the failover has to be complimented by the failback.
