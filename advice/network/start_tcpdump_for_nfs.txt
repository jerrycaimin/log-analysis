For NFS problem, we need data collection before OS reboot,
especially tcpdump output from both NFS server and client, like
'tcpdump -i <iface> -s0 -w <capfile> host <ip-address>'
ex: 
http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21633065


and ganesha trace on NFS server, which can enabled by
'ganesha_mgr set_log COMPONET_ALL FULL_DEBUG'

for five minutes. After that we can stop ganesha trace by
'ganesha_mgr set_log COMPONET_ALL EVENT'

and collect gpfs.snap.
