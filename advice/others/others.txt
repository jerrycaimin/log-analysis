Hi, I am GPFS L2 and looking at this ticket, I'm now retrieving your snap for detail analysis.
I will bring back update to you once snap is fully reviewed. And the
problem may also be delivered to a dev for deeper review if necessary.

BTW, tomorrow I'll be out of office until Sept 5th. During this time if
it needs urgent help you can put a note in the PMR and one of my
colleagues would handle it accordingly or open a new one.

Hi Robert,

it's Marco here from HPC support.
In order to investigate the issue please collect and upload the GPFS
snap:

1. run /usr/lpp/mmfs/bin/gpfs.snap (on one node it will gather data from
the other nodes)
	Page 13 of 136
2. This will generate a file in /tmp/gpfs.snapOut/ called
all.(timestamp).tar please rename it to 02597.077.724.gpfs.tar
3. upload options are available here:
