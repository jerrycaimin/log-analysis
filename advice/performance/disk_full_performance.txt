1. Suboptimal performance can be experienced due to file system being fully utilized. 
As a file system nears full utilization, it becomes difficult to find free space for new blocks, 
this will impact the performance of write, append and create operations. According to your mmdf output, 
t24backup is 95% used, and 3 NSDs (out of total 4) are with 0% free full blocks. To avoid performance downgrade, 
you can add more disks to that FS, and rebalance the FS using mmrestripefs when system is idle. 

2. Unbalanced disk usage can also limit bandwidth. It can result in hot spots in one or a few disks. 
Presence of hot spots within a system can also cause performance degradation. For a better performance, 
it is better to use uniformed disk speeds, equal LUN sizes, and balanced access to storage. 
According to your mmdf output, FS t24backup has 4 disks with different sizes, 2 4T + 1 512G + 1 1T, 
3 of them 0% free full blocks left, and 1 of them 48% free. Fs t24data01 has 11 disks, all 1T in size, 
but some 1% free, some 17~18% free and some 71~85%. Both FS are not well balanced. Note that, after you add, 
change or delete disks in a file system, you can run "mmrestripefs -b" to rebalance the FS. 
Balancing of files is an IO intensive and time-consuming operation, you are recommend to run it during system idle time. 
And it is important only for file systems with large files that are mostly invariant, in many cases, 
normal file update and creation will rebalance your file system over time, without the cost of the re-balancing.
