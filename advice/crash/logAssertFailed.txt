If the log assert triggered kernel panic, causing the node to reboot.
Suggestion:
Q: The assert Condition can be found in psdb?
	[A] Yes, It's an existed problem, does it fixed?
		[A1] Yes, fixed. Talked with dev to make eFix on this issue, PFE need simple function verify, if fix part is danger, may involve test team help to test. The deliver to customer.
		[B1] Not yet. Talk with developer, try to open the trace and recreate the issue, open a RTC if necessary. If can be fixed, do [A1], if it cannot be recreated, close the pmr and reopen it next time hit.
	[B] No, it's a new issue, do as [B1].


Here is the step to open trace and recreate the problem in customer env, if allowed by customer.

1. Start trace
[AIX]
mmtracectl --start --aix-trace-buffer-size=128M --trace-file-size=256M -N all

[Linux]
mmtracectl --start --trace-file-size=512M -N all

2. When we have slowness, please also run this command
mmdsh -N all "/usr/lpp/mmfs/bin/mmfsadm saferdump all > /tmp/mmfs/service.\$(hostname -s).safer.dumpall.\$(date +"%m%d%H%M%S")"

3. Retry the operations that made log assert failed.
 
4. Cut traceoff and stop trace after:
mmtracectl --stop -N all
mmtracectl --off
