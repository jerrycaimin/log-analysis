Such command?s leave corresponding records, for instance, "mmfsd is shutting down". And we do not have that.

This accident should be a signal kill, like "kill -9 <mmfsd pid>". This signal may come from

1. key storkes
2. linux kernel like OOM (Out of memory) killer
3, some user-deployed tools/scripts
We have seen all three cases that happened in our previous support cases of other customers.
Possibility 2 usually leaves record in /var/log/messsages. But we do not have such message there.
This machine also had plenty of free memory when we collected gpfs.snap, hours after the event.
So this posssibility looks trival. But it does not hurt to check memory usage history, if we have that.
