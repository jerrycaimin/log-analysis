For disk IO waiters, generally it means gpfs has dispatched IOs to 
disk/storage subsystem but still waiting for reply, if there are many IOs 
waiters, reported from nsd node, are pending there more than 0.02s, it 
will bring pref impact to your cluster. 

So this might be some hardware abnormal that downgrade the performance, please 
try to review the hardware environment to resolve the problem.

Also try use tool iohist.awk: 
>iohist.awk slowdata=1000 internaldump.* | grep "E2_GPFS_*" | awk {'print $11'} | sort | uniq -c 
could find how many slowdata existed.
