Hi Arturo,

This is GPFS L2 support for your case, from your question I know ?you want to know more about GPFS snapshots and how to
backup snapshot, here I can give some explanation.

?
?By default if you run mmcrsnapshot it will create a folder under /gpfs/.snapshot/, example:
mmcrsnapshot gpfs1 snap1


There will be /gpfs1/.snapshot/snap1 created and contains all the foloders/files at the time you capture the snapshot.
At the very beginning the size you can see this folder is several K like 50K, this is because the snapshot data and
original online fs data share the same data address, once the online fs gets changed, the snapshot size becomes bigger,
example, if you delete a 10G file: /gpfs1/test10Gfile, then the size of folder /gpfs1/.snapshot/snap1 will increase from
 50K to 10G, we call it "copy on write" feature.

But you cannot do mmcrsnapshot on a existed snapshot, however that snapshot folder contains all the files at at the
time you capture the snapshot, you can just directly copy this folder to another place for your backup purpose, or use
"mmbackup -S snapshot" to backup to TSM backup server.
