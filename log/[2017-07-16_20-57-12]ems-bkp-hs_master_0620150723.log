The issue [node expel issue due to tcp configuration] is highly happened.
Please refer the advice:
This problem may happen due to tpc configuration error. You may need do the following tcp optimized actions to fix the problem.
1) Check the io node tcp settings in etc/sysctl.conf, make sure the following is set:
	net.ipv4.tcp_low_latency = 1
	net.ipv4.tcp_sack = 1
	net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 1
	net.core.rmem_default = 16777216
	net.core.rmem_max = 16777216
	net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096    87380    16777216
	net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096    65536    16777216

   Check the etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-bond-bond0, make sure the following tag is set properly:
	BONDING_OPTS="mode=802.3ad miimon=100 xmit_hash_policy=layer3+4"
	MTU=9000
						
2) Check the client tcp settings, make sure the following is set:
	net.ipv4.tcp_low_latency = 1
	net.ipv4.tcp_sack = 1
	net.ipv4.tcp_timestamps = 1
	net.core.rmem_max = 8388608
	net.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 4096    87380    8388608
	net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096    65536    8388608

   Check client node: etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-bond-bond0, make sure the following tag is set properly:
	BONDING_OPTS="mode=4 xmit_hash_policy=layer3+4 miimon=100"
	MTU=9000
